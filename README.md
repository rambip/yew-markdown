# Goal
creating a simple library to render markdown with yew.
The best rust libraries are involved !

# CSS
To use katex, don't forget to add this stylesheet in your html:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.7/dist/katex.min.css" integrity="sha384-3UiQGuEI4TTMaFmGIZumfRPtfKQ3trwQE2JgosJxCnGmQpL/lJdjpcHkaaFwHlcI" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

# Showcase
the example is included in `./examples/showcase`
