# Disclaimer

This project will move to **https://github.com/rambip/rust-web-markdown**

 Be sure to check it out and to star the project !

# Goal
Creating a simple library to render markdown with yew.
The best rust crates are involved !

# Usage
Add yew-markdown to your project:
```toml
# Cargo.toml
yew-markdown = {git="https://github.com/rambip/yew-markdown"}
```

If you just need to render basic markdown, you can do

```rust
use yew_markdown::Markdown;
...
    html!{
        <Markdown src={"# Markdown power !"}/>
    }
```

# Examples
Take a look at the different examples !
You just need trunk and a web-browser to test them.

## Showcase
the example is included in `./examples/showcase`

Here is an illustration:
